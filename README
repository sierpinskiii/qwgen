qwgen
=====

Generates random password using the Hadamard Gates in qiskit.

Works with Python3. Requires pyperclip and qiskit. Install them with pip.

Warning: It uses the qasm **simulator**. It's not implementing real quantum randomness but mimicking them with qiskit's simulator. So don't use it for serious work.

Usage:
  -c, --clipboard           copies generated password into the clipboard
  -l <num>, --length <num>  password length
